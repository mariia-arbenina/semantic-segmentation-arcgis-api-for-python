-- The Notebook Semantic_Segmentation_Roads_Buildings.ipynb in this repository includes the following incstructions:

- Where to download satellite imagery datasets for roads and buildings pixel classification
- How to pre-process the data and prepare input datasets needed for a prediction model training via arcgis.learn Python module
- How to train and validate two models for detecting roads and buildings footprints from satellite imagery
- How to evaluate models' performance and test them using ArcGIS Pro native tools

The notebook also contains example imagery, models' output metrics and plots, as well as prediction outcome on previously unseen satellite images.

/resources/ folder contains images used in the notebook and subsets of images used for generating training input.
